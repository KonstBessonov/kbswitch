=kbswitch2= lets you switch quickly and easily between keyboard layouts
in Windows.

If you've ever used Mac OS X -- it's now as easy as that.

If you've never used Mac OS X, trust me: that means it's easy.

* Features

- Unintrusive. One discreet notification area icon. (Also, doesn't
  randomly mess up Visual Studio debugging.)

- Doesn't use a keyboard shortcut. No more accidental layout switches.
  (Note: can be integrated with keyboard shortcut programs such as
  [[http://www.autohotkey.com/][AutoHotkey]], if you o want keyboard control.)

- Reliable. No more arguments with the language bar.

- Hassle-free. No installation required, can run off thumb drive,
  doesn't change your profile, doesn't save anything to disk.

- Can integrate with 

* Download

*kbswitch2 is experimental* - you need to get it from the github repo!

* Installation

Copy kbswitch2's =bi= folder somewhere (rename it if you like), and
run =kbswitch2.exe=. You could put a shortcut to it in the Startup
folder of your Start Menu, so that it runs when Windows starts.

=kbswitch2= doesn't need to save any data anywhere. You can run it off
a flash drive or other removable storage.

* Use

When =kbswitch2= is running, it will keep a little icon in the
notification area, that looks a bit like a closeup of a keyboard.

[[./doc_imgs/kbswitch_icon.png]]

Hover over the icon to see the currently set layout.

[[./doc_imgs/kbswitch_tip.png]]

Right-click on the icon to get a popup menu listing available keyboard
layouts. Select one to change to that layout.

[[./doc_imgs/kbswitch_menu.png]]

Select "Exit" to exit. The current keyboard layout remains set for
active applications. You may find that when you run other
applications, they use your default keyboard layout.

(You can re-run =kbswitch2= to sort this out.)

* Command line options

=kbswitch2= supports a couple of command line options.

- =/showWindow= - if specified, show a normal window as well as the
  notification icon. You can right click in the window to get the
  popup menu.

- =/nextLayout=, =/prevLayout= /does nothing unless =kbswitch2= is
  already running/ - select the next or previous keyboard layout in
  the list. Intended for use with AutoHotkey, so you can assign
  keyboard shortcuts to cycle through the list of layouts. (If
  =kbswitch2= isn't running, doing this will do absolutely nothing, so
  you won't load =kbswitch2= accidentally.)

If you specify anything else on the command line, it's interpreted as
the name (ignoring case) of a keyboard layout to select. If
=kbswitch2= is running, that layout will be selected; if it's not
running, it will be started.

For example, to select the Dvorak layout:

: kbswitch2 "united states-dvorak"

* Notes

- *kbswitch2 is experimental*!

- If you change language when a program is loading, it may not pick up
  the change. To fix this, use =kbswitch= to reselect the selected
  language once the program looks to be ready.

- _XP only_ - the Ctrl+Alt+Del screen uses your default
  keyboard. Watch out when using keyboard shortcuts, and in particular
  when entering your password!

* Other credits

- The code for [[http://clabs.org/dvorak.htm][DVAssist]] demonstrated how to change the layout
  properly. (My original attempt was way over-complicated, and didn't
  work anyway.)

- The icon comes from a freeware icons collection that I downloaded a
  few years ago.
