* kbswitch

=kbswitch= switches the keyboard layout in Windows, globally.

To run it, run =kbswitch/bin/kbswitch.exe=. (If you want to copy it to
another PC, this is the only file necessary - the program is entirely
self-contained.)

For instructions, see [[kbswitch/README.org][=kbswitch/README.org=]].

Works on Windows XP.

* kbswitch2

*=kbswitch2= is experimental!*

=kbswitch2= switches the keyboard layout in Windows, globally.

To run it, run =kbswitch2/bin/kbswitch2.exe=. (If you want to copy it
to another PC, you need all the files in this folder - unfortunately
=kbswitch2= is a bit more complicated than =kbswitch=.)

Should work on all editions of XP, Vista and Windows 7, but only
tested on Windows 7 x64.

*=kbswitch2= is experimental!*
