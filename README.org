=kbswitch= lets you switch quickly and easily between keyboard layouts
in Windows.

If you've ever used Mac OS X -- it's now as easy as that.

If you've never used Mac OS X, trust me: that means it's easy.

* Features

- Unintrusive. One discreet notification area icon. (Also, doesn't
  randomly mess up Visual Studio debugging.)

- Doesn't use a keyboard shortcut. No more accidental layout switches.

- Reliable. No more arguments with the language bar.

- Hassle-free. Single EXE, no install required, can run off thumb
  drive, doesn't change your profile, doesn't save anything to disk.

- Optional. Leave it running all the time, or run it just when you
  need it.

* Download

[[./kbswitch.zip][=kbswitch.zip=]] (25K - EXE, docs, source code)

* Installation

Copy supplied =kbswitch.exe= somewhere, and run it.

=kbswitch= is perfectly happy being run just when you need to switch
layouts. You can also put a shortcut to it in the Startup folder of
your Start Menu, so that it runs when Windows starts.

=kbswitch= is a single EXE file, and doesn't need to save any data
anywhere. You can run it off a flash drive or other removable storage.

* Use

When =kbswitch= is running, it will keep a little icon in the
notification area, that looks a bit like a closeup of a keyboard.

[[./doc_imgs/kbswitch_icon.png]]

Hover over the icon to see the currently set layout.

[[./doc_imgs/kbswitch_tip.png]]

Right-click on the icon to get a popup menu listing available keyboard
layouts. Select one to change to that layout.

[[./doc_imgs/kbswitch_menu.png]]

Select "Exit" to exit. The current keyboard layout remains set. (You
can re-run =kbswitch= if you need to switch again later.)

* Notes

- If you look in the Regional and Language Options section of the
  Control Panel after changing the layout, you'll see that the current
  keyboard is set as the default. Don't worry -- if you change using
  =kbswitch=, this new default is NOT saved. Next time you log on,
  you'll get your default default.

- Satisfaction is not guaranteed when combined with other layout
  switching programs. (=kbswitch= may behave correctly, but the tool
  tip may be incorrect. Just needs fixing.)

- If you change language when a program is loading, it may not pick up
  the change. (There are probably other situations where this can
  happen, too.) To fix this, use =kbswitch= to reselect the selected
  language once the program looks to be ready.

- The Ctrl+Alt+Del screen uses your default keyboard. Watch out when
  using keyboard shortcuts, and in particular when entering your
  password!

  I doubt there's anything I can do about this; that screen is
  presumably specially designed to be impervious to attack :)

- Only tested on 32-bit Windows XP.

* Other credits

- The code for [[http://clabs.org/dvorak.htm][DVAssist]] demonstrated how to change the layout
  properly. (My original attempt was way over-complicated, and didn't
  work anyway.)

- The icon comes from a freeware icons collection that I downloaded a
  few years ago.
